# Research Based AI Projects

If you think back 30 years, humans could never have dreamed that artificial intelligence would take such a big step forward and have such a positive impact on our lives. Artificial Intelligence has accelerated life’s pace. Artificial intelligence (AI) has given rise to applications that are now having a significant impact on our lives.

The term AI was initially coined in 1956 at a Dartmouth meeting. Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of a computer or a computer-controlled robot to accomplish tasks that would normally be performed by intelligent beings. In today’s world, Artificial Intelligence has become highly popular. It is the simulation of human intelligence in computers that have been programmed to learn and mimic human actions. These machines can learn from their mistakes and execute activities that are similar to those performed by humans.

Building an AI system is a painstaking process of reversing our features and talents in a machine and then leveraging its computing strength to outperform our abilities. To comprehend how Artificial Intelligence works, one must go deeply into the many sub-domains of AI and comprehend how those domains can be applied to various industries of the industry. Machine learning, deep learning, neural networks, computer vision, and natural language processing are examples of these fields.

AI adapts by allowing data to program itself using progressive learning algorithms. In order for algorithms to learn, AI looks for structure and regularities in data. An algorithm can train itself to play chess, just as it can educate itself to recommend a product. Deep neural networks are used by AI to attain remarkable precision. Your interactions with Alexa and Google, for example, are all based on deep learning. And the more you use these things, the more accurate they become. Deep learning and object identification AI techniques can now be utilized in the medical profession to spot cancer on medical photos with greater accuracy.

In this Repo, you will come across various such applications of artificial intelligence that can be opted as a project idea for various personal or educational purposes.
